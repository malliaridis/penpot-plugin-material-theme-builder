# Getting Started

### 1. Add the plugin to your project

To use the plugin, add it to your project via the following plugin URL:

```
https://malliaridis.github.io/penpot-plugin-material-theme-builder/manifest.json
```

For more information on how to add plugins, refer to
[penpot plugins - Getting started](https://help.penpot.app/plugins/getting-started/).

### 2. Before you create a theme

Before you create your first theme, you should decide where you want to store
it. Since hundreds of values are generated, it is recommended to store the theme
assets in a separate file which you then publish and import as a library.

Later, if you want to switch between themes or toggle between the light and dark
theme, you can use the plugin in your actual file where you use it.

You are free to use it directly in the file you are working on as well. However,
bear in mind that the theme builder may override or delete existing values if
you use paths or names that conflict with the ones used by the theme builder.
Therefore, it is safer to add the theme assets always in separate files.

See [Organizing your Project Files](organizing-files.md) for more information.

### 3. Create your first theme

You are able to create a theme directly in the file you are working on, or add
it in a separate library as described in
[Organizing your Project Files](organizing-files.md).

### 4. Use the theme assets

The only thing you have to do now is to use your theme assets in your
components.

### 5. Try out the plugin's features

The plugin provides helper features that makes it easy to swap theme values and
toggle between light and dark theme variants.
